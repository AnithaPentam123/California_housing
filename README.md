# California_housing
California Housing Data Analysis This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on the California Housing dataset using Python. It includes step-by-step data processing, visualization, and application of machine learning techniques to understand and predict housing prices in California.

🔍 Objective
To analyze the California housing dataset, derive insights from key features, and build a model to predict median house values based on available attributes.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

pandas, numpy – for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization

scikit-learn – for preprocessing and regression modeling

📌 Key Features
Data loading and preprocessing

Handling missing values and data types

Feature correlation analysis and visualization

Regression model training and evaluation (e.g., Linear Regression)

Data-driven insights into California housing patterns

📈 Output
Visualizations showing housing patterns by location, population, and median income

A trained regression model for predicting house values

Performance metrics like R² score and mean squared error

💡 Use Case
This notebook serves as a beginner-friendly example of how to apply data science techniques to real-world datasets. It’s ideal for learners exploring regression modeling, data cleaning, and EDA workflows.
